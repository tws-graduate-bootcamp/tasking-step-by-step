# Guide

In this test we will focus on how to create a reasonable name for your task. The practices will be grouped into 2 parts. In the first part, we will try to recognize functions with confusing names; while in the second part, we will write tasks and create our own functions according to descriptions.

## Part I

* AC1: Please read the all the tests and try to rename the function according to your understanding.
* AC2: Draw the tasking diagram of the functions defined in *renamingPractice.js* (just for the facade layer). The diagram must including the following part:
    * The name of the task
    * The input of the task
    * The output of the task

## Part II

In this test, we will try creating our own task name from the description. Each description contains only one task name.

* Question 1: We would like to know if a barcode is valid or not.
* Question 2: We would like to create a printed receipt from the a collection of barcodes.
* Question 3: We would like to know if the picture contains a cat.
* Question 4: We would like to create an encrpted message for text using specified password.
