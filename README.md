# Tasking via Diagram (Step-By-Step)

## Business Requirement

This repository is a step-by-step guide for tasking. After the practice, you should be able to draw a tasking diagram that satisfying the following requirements:

* Each task block should have a reasonable name.
* Each task block can contain multiple inputs and should contain only one output.
* The data structure of each input and output should be explicitly defined in the diagram.
* All the information defined in the output should be found or inferred, either directly or indirectly from the inputs.
* Each layer should 100% cover the full question.
* The task block in the leaf layer should be an obvious question to you and could be implemented in a certain amount of time.
